# My reading of PEP-622

After reading the recently proposed [PEP-622](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0622/) and the discussion that ensued in the [python-dev](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-dev@python.org/thread/RFW56R7LTSC3QSNIZPNZ26FZ3ZEUCZ3C/) mailing list I wanted to write some notes. Both to organise my own thoughts but also to share with other people discussing this topic.
